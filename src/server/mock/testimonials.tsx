        Working with Erick was very good for my career. From the way he manages
        teams to the technologies and programming techniques used, it makes both
        the team work better and any application easy to understand, applying{" "}
        <Highlight>legible market standards</Highlight>. It was with him that I
        learned about <Highlight>unit tests</Highlight> and the main programming
        patterns with <Highlight>Next.js</Highlight>. I had the privilege of
        managing a team of devs, and I applied everything that Erick had already
        done in other projects, which made the devs who stayed with me miss
        working on that project that had everything good and the best. The guy
        is awesome üòÅ

        I had the opportunity to work with Erick at the beginning of my

        excelled in enhancing{" "}
        <Highlight>team cohesion, good code standards, and practices</Highlight>
        . He consistently guided us to work collaboratively, encouraging growth
        beyond mere coding and feature development. Whenever possible, Erick

        careers as <Highlight>software engineers</Highlight>. I had an amazing
        time working with him.
